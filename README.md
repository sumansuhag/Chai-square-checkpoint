# Chi-Square Test Analysis

## Overview
This notebook demonstrates how to perform a Chi-Square test to determine if there is a significant association between two categorical variables. The analysis will include data loading, exploration, and visualization of results.

## Installation
Make sure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scipy matplotlib seaborn

Results and Interpretation
- If the p-value is less than the significance level (commonly 0.05), we reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a significant association between the two categorical variables.
- If the p-value is greater than the significance level, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.


Conclusion
In this notebook, we performed a Chi-Square test to analyze the association between two categorical variables. The results indicated whether or not there is a significant relationship between the variables.

### How to Use This Template
1. **Create a New Jupyter Notebook**: Open Jupyter Notebook and create a new notebook.
2. **Copy the Markdown and Code**: Copy the above content into your new notebook, separating the markdown cells from the code cells.
3. **Run the Cells**: Execute the cells to perform the analysis.

### Summary
This structured approach provides a comprehensive guide to performing a Chi-Square test in a Jupyter Notebook. You can modify the code snippets to fit your specific dataset and analysis needs. If you have any further questions or need additional assistance, feel free to ask!
